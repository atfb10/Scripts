# Pace Me

### Background 
- I am training for large-scale mountaineering objectives
- Regardless of whether I am trail running, or practicing a grueling hike with a heavy pack; knowing speed is important
- Speed will determine which objectives I know I can reasonably achieve in similar terrain in a specific time window

### Instructions 
- Place file in desired directory
- Navigate to the directory in your terminal
- Run the script by typing the following command "py pace_me.py"
- Enter arguments
- Type 'y' or 'Y' to run again; or 'n' or 'N' to exit the program
